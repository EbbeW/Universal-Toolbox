# 🧰 Universal Toolbox

*The glorified graveyard for your throwaway Python trash that somehow keeps saving your ass.*

## 🚀 What is this?

You know those quick Python scripts you duct-tape together in 3 minutes to rename files, batch-edit something, or extract the pain from your soul?
No time for structure, no time to setup a virtual environment, just one file of shit code.

Yeah, this is a toolbox to collect exactly those pieces of shitty python. It's a great way to give your scripts the live they barely still deserve and to reuse them in the future, imagine about actually reusing them or just growing your ego on the amount of shit code you now own.
This tool is just as *quickly thrown together* as the scripts it's made to manage. No shame. It works. That’s good enough.

It also lives nice and conveniently inside your Windows Explorer's or desktop's context menu. No app, no nothing.. It's always right there, where you need it.

## 🛠️ How to Use It

### 🧪 Add a Script to the Toolbox

1. Write your beautiful, horrific little `.py` script.
2. Right-click it in your Desktop or whatever place you're trashing with it in Windows Explorer.
3. Select **“Add to Toolbox”**. (in windows 11, it's under 'Show more options')
4. Fill in a name, category, and a one-sentence apology description to bless the clueless future you.
5. That’s it. It's in.

### 🔁 Run a Script from the Toolbox

1. Right-click **any empty space** in a folder or your desktop.
2. Choose **“Universal Toolbox”** from the context menu.
3. Browse your beautifully chaotic collection of tools.
4. When you pick one:

   * A GUI will pop up that **magically detects your ALL\_CAPS global variables**. (cuz be real. All your shit code runs on this config convention)
   * You can customize these before running, unless you just want to use the hardcoded path you used 3 months ago when you made the tool.
   * You know, like `INPUT_DIR = "C:/Some/Jank"` — yeah, *those*.

🧭 **Everything runs relative to where you right-clicked**.
So if your script writes files, reads paths, or destroys the universe — it does it *right there*.

## 🐍 Requirements

* Python installed
* No virtual environment, cuz you didn't make one when creating your tools anyway
* Sanity optional
* Your scripts don’t need any SDK, wrapper, or even decency. Just global ALL\_CAPS config vars.

---

## 👎 No Promises

* There’s no structure.
* There’s no cleanup.
* There’s no undo.
* And there are **no regrets**.

Isn't it perfect?
